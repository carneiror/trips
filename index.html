When we got here we've alreay been to Galway and Killarney so we were used to a beautiful and lighten up Ireland. Cork is a grey city with not much to offer. I hope I'm offending anyone :/ it was just my impression and I admit it may have been my fault."},{"date":"13-04-2017","title":"Dublin","filename":"13-04-2017-Dublin.md.html","image":"https://carneiror.github.io/trips/images/Ireland/kilmainham_gaol.jpg","summary":"As any other capital in the World, Dublin has a lot of things to do/visit."},{"date":"13-04-2017","title":"Galway","filename":"13-04-2017-Galway.md.html","image":"https://carneiror.github.io/trips/images/Ireland/galway.jpg","summary":"If you draw an horizontal line from Dublin to the West, you will find Galway at the end of the main isle of Ireland."},{"date":"13-04-2017","title":"Ireland","filename":"13-04-2017-Ireland.md.html","image":"https://carneiror.github.io/trips/images/Ireland/sheeps.jpg","summary":"On April 2017 my boyfriend and I decided to make a road trip throughout Ireland. We spent 11 days there divided by 3 in Dublin, 1 in Northern Ireland and 7 going from Galway to Dublin through the South."},{"date":"13-04-2017","title":"Killarney","filename":"13-04-2017-Killarney.md.html","image":"https://carneiror.github.io/trips/images/Ireland/dingle.jpg","summary":"Two of the most beautiful circuits to make in Ireland are the Dingle Peninsula and the the Ring of Kerry. Killarney is a small and pictoresque city where many people, including us, stay overnight when they want to visit them."},{"date":"13-04-2017","title":"Limmerick","filename":"13-04-2017-Limmerick.md.html","image":"https://carneiror.github.io/trips/images/Ireland/Limmerick.jpg","summary":"We didn't spend much time in this picturesque village. You stopped here by lunch hour on our way from Galway to Killarney. And I have to say it was one of our best decisions."},{"date":"13-04-2017","title":"Northern-Ireland","filename":"13-04-2017-Northern-Ireland.md.html","image":"https://carneiror.github.io/trips/images/Ireland/wall_of_shame.jpg","summary":"We initially thought of adding some days to the visit the Northern Ireland but after asking around in foruns and such we decided it was a bad ideia considering the amount of days we had available."},{"date":"18-07-2019","title":"Non-Safari-Tanzania","filename":"18-07-2019-Non-Safari-Tanzania.md.html","image":"https://carneiror.github.io/trips/images/Tanzania/beach.jpg","summary":"The most obvious one is **beach in Zanzibar**. We stayed in Kendwa, upnorth (a calm beach near the most touristy one, Nungwi). The water is good, though not as good as in Thailand for instance (or it was just a bad year…). The temperature was around 24-25 ºC. The beach itself is very good. We were just unfortunate to have rain falling down on us almost everyday. It wouldn’t last very long but the sky was seldom clear. But obviously it’s not always like that, we were just unlucky (even though we were there in the beginning of August, which is already the start of the dry season)."},{"date":"18-07-2019","title":"Tanzania","filename":"18-07-2019-Tanzania.md.html","image":"https://carneiror.github.io/trips/images/Tanzania/elephants.jpg","summary":"In 2019, my boyfriend and I went on a Safari to Tanzania. We were excited and, at the same time, afraid it wouldn’t match our expectations (our previous and first major travel was a huge success). But I can honestly say it did :) We booked with [Roam Serengeti Safaris](https://www.safaribookings.com/p3237) and couldn't have asked for anyone better."}]</script>
