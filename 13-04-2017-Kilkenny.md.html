<h1 id="kilkenny">Kilkenny</h1>
<p>Kilkenny is a small but pictoresque town. We only spent about one hour here as we wanted to get to Dublin in time to see the Book of Kells, but we would have liked to spend more time here.</p>
<p>We were able to visit St. Mary&#39;s Cathedral and to hang for a bit on the gardens of Kilkenny&#39;s castle.</p>

<p>We really enjoyed how the community was able to use that space for several of their day to day activities. There was, for instance, a class practicing exercise, running around the perimeter.</p>
<p>One thing that really stuck with us was the people, they were always so nice. There was even one man who noticed we were foreigners and came and talked to us wanting to know what had brought us to the city and what we thought of it and even offered some really cool tips about the city. One of them was the Conferation Hall, where a parliament was elected during the first year of the Irish Conferate Wars (a.k.a., Eleven Year&#39;s War) to unite and represent the Catholic side of the war.</p>

<p>Had we known we would enjoy the town as much as we did, we would have spent the night here instead of Cork.</p>
