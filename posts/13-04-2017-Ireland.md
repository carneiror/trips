# 11 Days around Ireland (including 1 day Northern Ireland)

## How to get around in Ireland
It depends where you want to go. Within Dublin the metro system is very good and it takes you almost everywhere. DO NOT (and I really mean it) think of renting a car while in Dublin. It's really messy and you'll end up just getting stuck in transit.
On the other hand, **once you leave Dublin you really ought to rent a car**. It's really easy. Just go to any of the car rental services. You can find them in several places, being the easiest one the airport itself.

## How to get to the city centre from the airport (and vice-versa)
There are several [shuttle companies](https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus/dublin-buses) that can take you. We used the Airlink Express and bought the tickets at the airport.

## Expenses
Ireland is not a cheap country. We spent around 2700€ for 11 days (two people), which included:
* Accommodations: 900€ (at best, included breakfast)
* Car Rental: 344€ through Budget Rent for 7 days (Sunday to Saturday)

## Dublin
As any other capital in the World, Dublin has a lot of things to do/visit.

### Kilmainham Gaol
This is an old prison that stayed in Ireland history because it housed many famous figures in the fight for Irish independence, including Thomas Francis Meagher and James Connolly. It was also the site for several executions and hangings.

As in any visit to an old prison, the athmosphere is a bit heavy. But it's totally worth it. Don't worry, you won't feel sick even if you're quite sensitive. Nevertheless, get ready for some shocking stories.
