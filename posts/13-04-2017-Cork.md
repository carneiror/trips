# Cork

If I'm to be completely honest, I didn't really Cork. When we got here we've alreay been to Galway and Killarney so we were used to a beautiful and lighten up Ireland. Cork is a grey city with not much to offer. I hope I'm offending anyone :/ it was just my impression and I admit it may have been my fault.

## Blarney Castle
The Blarney Castle is famous for its Stone of Eloquence. History goes that those who kiss the stone will be blessed with the gift of Eloquence. Whether or not you believe it is irrelevant as, even if you don't intend to kiss the stone, the castle's gardens are enough to fully justify a visit.

Whenever I travel I like to try as much as possible, for the sheer feeling of having done it (of course this isn't always possible, like when my fear of heights takes the best of me). So, I obviously kissed the stone, which was actually a bit of an accomplishment for someone who's afraid of heights.

The gardens surrouding the castle are actally what people should look for when visiting it. They are gorgeous and immense.

__How much time to spend here__

The gardens are immense so you can actually spend as much time as you'd like. We arrived by the end of the morning and spent the rest of the day there. It's always better to check the [opening hours](https://blarneycastle.ie/pages/plan-your-visit) as they've actually changed since I've been there.

__How to buy tickets__

It's now possible to book your tickets [online](https://blarneycastle.ie/tickets) but there's no need for that unless you want the 2â‚¬ online discount.
