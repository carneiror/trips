<p>It depends where you want to go. Within Dublin the <a href="https://www.dublinpublictransport.ie/dublin-trams">tram system</a>, they call it LUNA,  is quite good and it takes you almost everywhere. <strong>DO NOT</strong> (and I really mean it) think of renting a car while in Dublin. It&#39;s really messy and you&#39;ll end up just getting stuck in transit.
On the other hand, <strong>once you leave Dublin you really ought to rent a car</strong>. It&#39;s really easy. Just go to any of the car rental services. You can find them in several places, being the easiest one the airport itself.</p>

<p>There are several <a href="https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus/dublin-buses">shuttle companies</a> that can take you. We used the Airlink Express and bought the tickets at the airport.</p>
<h2 id="expenses">Expenses</h2>
<p>Ireland is not a cheap country. We spent around 2700€ for 11 days (two people), which included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accommodations: 900€ (some included breakfast)</li>
<li>Car Rental: 344€ through Budget Rent for 7 days (Sunday to Saturday) for a Seat Ibiza</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, if you&#39;re wondering if you should take your kids here, the answer is yes. It&#39;s quite a children friendly trip.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-would-have-done-differently">What I would have done differently</h2>
<p>I would have skipped Cork altogether. It&#39;s a gray city without anything to show for it and I really didn&#39;t like it (I don&#39;t mean to offend anyone, it&#39;s just my opinion :D). Instead of Cork, on my way to Dublin, I would have stayed in Kilkenny, which was a small but pictoresque town.</p>
