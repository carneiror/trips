<h1 id="limmerick">Limmerick</h1>
<p>We didn&#39;t spend much time in this picturesque village. You stopped here by lunch hour on our way from Galway to Killarney. And I have to say it was one of our best decisions.</p>
<p>The village is small and cute and it has a castle right in its midst, which is actually visitable. It&#39;s King&#39;s John&#39;s Castle and even though it dates back to the thirteen century, the remains of a Viking settlement were uncovered underneath it during some archeological exchavations.</p>

<p>You can walk around the patio and see some of the old instruments that were used back in the days, as well as go inside it and see some of the different rooms that were used. They are displayed in a way to mimic the old days.</p>
<p>You can also go up the turrets for some views of the city.</p>
<p>At the exit of the castle there is a small cafe, where you can grab something to eat (a sandwich for instance).</p>
<p><strong>How to buy tickets</strong>
Each ticket costs 13â‚¬ but you can save 10% if you buy them <a href="https://www.kingjohnscastle.com/book-tickets/">online</a>.</p>
<p>The opening hours depend on the month of the year, so it&#39;s better to check <a href="https://carneiror.github.io/kingjohnscastle.com/castle-tour/">online</a>.</p>

<p>Within the village there is also a small church and the river is really nice.</p>
<p>After Limmerick we drove to Killarney but we actually stopped by a lot of places to take pictures. If you think you see something you like, just stop. You can thank me later :D</p>
